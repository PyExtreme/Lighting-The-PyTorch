# Lighting-The-PyTorch
This repository contains the practical guide to using PyTorch for data preprocessing, model training and exaluation

**PyTorch is an Open source Machine Learning library for python, based on Torch.**

This tutorial focusses on implementing Image classification task using PyTorch


Training a classifier involves these steps:
* **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
* **Model Selection**
* **Defining a loss function**
* **Training the classifier, validation and Parameter tuning**

All these steps have been well described in the IPython Notebook.
